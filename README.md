## Overview

Hey iOS buddies! üëã Ever felt lost in coding puzzles, especially with async tasks and network requests? No worries ‚Äì we're on a mission to simplify it. Crafting a networking solution that's not just effective but native, easy to understand, fully covered by unit testing, and still simple.

Recently, I built a networking layer for a scalable project using Combine. Thanks to insights from our awesome community, I found a strong yet simple way. Readability and ease of use matter! I want to share it with you. We're also adding 100% unit test coverage, ensuring our code is stable.

After building it, we'll think about isolating the networking solution in a separate module. Why? Many benefits! A modular approach in iOS development provides scalability, reusability, and easier testing. Each module can be developed independently, allowing teams to work simultaneously without interference. Swift Package Manager (SPM) is our helpful sidekick for modularizing our solution later.

So, let's dive in together, just like I do with my teammates. By the end, you'll not only understand but also become a coding maestro in iOS networking. Our focus isn't just on finishing quickly; it's about guiding you step-by-step. Scalability, cleanliness, and readability are the building blocks of our code.

## The Significance of a Strong Networking Layer üåê

A strong networking layer is vital in iOS development, acting as the backbone for smooth communication with servers. It connects our apps to the digital world, ensuring uninterrupted data flow and user experiences. This layer is essential for handling tasks like fetching data or making API calls, ensuring our applications respond promptly to user interactions.

## Solution High-Level Design üèóÔ∏è

Wondering how to start? Let's break it down. Consider our network's big picture ‚Äì what goes in, what comes out.

In the image above, you get a glimpse of our networking solution's big picture. Each request has an endpoint, including inputs like the base URL, path, method, headers, and body. We then pass this endpoint to the API client, our networking client, responsible for communicating with our servers. It returns a response for success or an error for failure.
